Similar arguments can be made for basically all the problem sizes.  We notice this rapidly drops off near the 25 numbers filled range, because there are less blank squares.\n",

Essentailly, instead of trying every possible numberm we are going to compute the 'domains' of each tile at each step. the domain of a square is the set of all possible values a square can take with out breaking the rules of sudoku.  So instead of trying all the numbers in `range(1, 10)` try all the numbers in `domain`, and update the domains at each guess.  I.e. if we add the number 1 in a square, 1 can't go in other places, so when we are trying to insert in those places, "
